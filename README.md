<!---# Thanks to all Sponsors and Supporters<br>

Your support would be invaluable for me to continue my ongoing and especially independent project developments.<br>
<br>
A small donation for a coffee or gladly more would already be very helpful.<br>
Ex: server rentals, monthly costs for domains, licenses etc.<br>
<br>
As a thank you I would return the favor with an IT service from my side. Let's talk about what you need!<br>
Ex: A business website, app, logo - whatever!<br>
<br>
Donations of $5 or more = A sponsor premium account on my project pages.<br>
Donations from 25$ = Print media development (Logo, Flyer, Banner - also animated!)<br>
Donations from 50$ = Web media development (WP plugins, website design etc.)<br>
Donations from 100$ = 10 free domain registrations including ssl certificate and hosting + premium webservice tools (Insights, SEO, URL-Shortening, Encryption Service etc.)<br>
Donations from 250$ = You will get your own server (Debian, Ubuntu, Centos or what ever) #woohaa!<br>
Donations from 500$ = CORPORATE DESIGN | Business Agency Website<br>
Donations from 1000$ = Let's talk!<br>
